请仔细检查下面我对16中时态的总结是否正确，包括其抽象、理解、例句，十分感谢
每个例句包含关键词develop, learn, English

1. past simple
   - 肯定句：
     - 静态抽象：S + was/were + N
     - 动态抽象：S + V2
   - 否定句：
     - 静态抽象：S + was/were not + N
     - 动态抽象：S + dit not + V1
   - 疑问句：
     - 静态抽象：Was/Were + S + N?
     - 动态抽象：Did + S + V1?
   - 理解：
     - was/were的意义：表达past。在静态句子中，was/were是为了将N这个状态赋予S，而在动态句子中不需要was/were，动词V2就是S发出的动作，其后应该会有宾语来接收
     - V2的意义：在没有助动词使只能有实意动词来表达past，所以不能是V1，而是要根据past来转换成V2
     - V2的特殊性：V2这个动词过去式在16中时态中只会出现在这个时态的肯定句中，因为在否定句和疑问句中会有do或do的变形来确定时态
     - 为什么否定句和疑问句中只用V1而不用V2：因为助动词do根据past变形为did后已经表达了过去这个时间信息
   - 例句：
     - I was a developer.
     - We were a team.
     - He was not a good developer.
     - He was neither a developer nor English speaker.
     - Were you a developer?
     - Was her learning English?
     - Was it finished?
     - I developed apps.
     - I did not develop apps.
     - Did you learn English?
     - Was he a good developer and what apps did he develop?
     - If you do this, then you didn't fail.
     - I was one of the development team when I was 27 years old.
     - I didn't finish the job, although I am so good.

   - 疑问句：
     - 静态抽象：Am/Is/Are + S + N?
     - 动态抽象：Do/Does + S + V1?
   - 理解：
     - am/is/are：将N这个状态赋予S
   - 例句：
     - Both you and I are team!
     - I am the clever motherfucker!
     - Do you know that? He was fucking mad!
     - I don't know!

   - 疑问句：
     - 静态抽象：Will + S + be + N?
     - 动态抽象：Will + S + V1?

   - 疑问句：
     - 静态抽象：Had + S + been + N?
     - 动态抽象：Had + S + V3?
   - 理解：
     - been的意义：将N这个状态赋予S，且因为是已经完成的状态，所以得是过去分词，就像动态句子中需要将V1变为V3

总结：

1. do及其变体只会存在于past simple和present simple的否定句和疑问句中
2. be/am/is/are/been的作用就是将一个状态赋予S
3. being的作用就是在continuous中表达continuous这个状态，且在有will或would时，它是需要省略的，因为will和would已经覆盖了它要表达的意思
4. V1只会出现在simple中
5. V2只会出现在past simple的肯定句中，因为其抽象是S + V2，这里如果不用V2就无法体现past
6. V3只会出现在perfect中
7. Ving只会出现在continuous中，无论是continuous还是perfect continuous
